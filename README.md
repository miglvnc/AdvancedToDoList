# Advanced ToDo List

Th app is based on simple toDo List create by using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

Application is created for training purpose and to practice dynamic DOM manipulating.

## Installation

Project available on [Github Pages](https://miglvnc.github.io/AdvancedToDoList/).

## Usage

Application contains a couple of functions that are not usually implemented in simple, first-app toDo list. I decided to prepare toDo List with:
- datetime picket for deadline of user's tasks;
- timecounter to count time remainig for each added task;
- sort buttons (by name and by time remaining);
- filter buttons that shows All tasks, finished tasks, current pending tasks;
- tools section for each tasks which includes complete task btn, edit btn and remove btn
- edit function allows to change name and deadline of time for task;
- if user edit time, timecounter will calculate new time remaining for task;
- some animations implementd
